# Drugs-Classification-using-Multiple-models
This project is used to predict which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
It is a sample of multiclass classifier an multiple machine learning models are used to compare results such as:
- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
The dataset is taken from kaggle [Drugs A, B, C, X, Y](https://www.kaggle.com/pablomgomez21/drugs-a-b-c-x-y-for-decision-trees)
